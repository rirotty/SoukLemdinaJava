When you're gonna create a test in this package, go to the "souklemdina" package, under the SoukLemdina.java class, comment
the main function (all of it), and comment any other main function in the classes of the com.souklemdina.tests package.
Have Fun <3

Always check the databases folder and import the new tables to souklemdina database to always have the full version of the
project on your machine.
